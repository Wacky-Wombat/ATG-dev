## To-Do
- [ ] https://github.com/12th-devs/Advanced-Tab-Groups/issues/111
- [ ] Add Arc & Edge Styles
- [ ] Allow folder to group conversion (@JustaDumbPrsn)
- [ ] Move color saving logic to session storage instead of JSON file
- [ ] Fix odd scrolling glitches
- [x] Add the font fade overflow effect
- [ ] Fix renaming glitches
- [ ] Add icon support
- [ ] Improve animations (mainly for the line, it does not get animated when you add a tab)
- [ ] Add the stashing feature (soonâ„¢)

These are in no specific order and just an idea of what is coming for the `v3.x.x` release line. I may also add star features because I wanna overtake Nebula
